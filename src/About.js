        <p id="textBody">
          Winter Retreat 2018 is quite simply the absolute best thing you can do to end 2018. Come and join brothers and sisters in Christ for
          an absolutely incredible time of fellowship, prayer, praise, intimacy and growth. There will be messages from the Word, praise music,
          intimate small groups, fun group games and activities, and of course amazing fine dining. It is also a great time to make friends as well, so if you
          completely don't know anyone who is going, you are sure to come back with exponentially more friends than when you first arrived.
          <br></br><br></br>
          "Winter Retreat is the greatest thing I have ever experienced" - every person who ever attended, 2017

          <br></br>
          This is the awesome theme for Winter Retreat 2018. It is awesome because it is from the Bible and the Bible is really cool and awesome. This
          verse embodies perseverance in our walk with Jesus.
